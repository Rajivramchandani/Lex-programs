# Count comments, keywords, identifiers, lines, words and spaces from an input file

## To run the code :
1.  Open a terminal in this folder or just use : 
    ```bash
    cd Count-identifiers-keywords-etc/
    ```

2.  Use the shell scripts from the parent folder with the input file name in the 2nd argument :
    ```bash
    ../run-and-delete.sh count-identifiers-keywords-etc.l input.txt
    ```
    You can also use run-and-keep.sh to create a new sub folder with the output files
