# Count number of words starting with 'A' or 'a'

## To run the code :
1.  Open a terminal in this folder or just use : 
    ```bash
    cd Words-starting-with-A/
    ```

2.  Use the shell scripts from the parent folder with the input file name in the 2nd argument :
    ```bash
    ../run-and-delete.sh words-starting-with-a.l input.txt
    ```
    You can also use run-and-keep.sh to create a new sub folder with the output files
